We will illustrate basic MPI with several C programs. This is also easy to do under Fortran.
The library call in your C program is #include "mpi.h" at the top of your C program.

We will use Open MPI and use the mpicc "wrapper" compiler to compile C programs. This just means that the wrapper takes care of links to library so you don't have to do it.

Executing MPI library compiled programs. One interesting fact is that you can run the executable in UNIX, with no regard to mpi. You usually use mpirun command. FOr example "mpirun -n 2 myprog " uses 2 processors to run executable myprog.
