# Quick-start-MPI

MPI is a widely used parallel programming library that uses message passing to communicate between processes. Recently, this model has been used in a hybrid way with other parallel programming models such as with OpenMP. In addition, there are wrappers for MPI to python (mpi4py) and Julia. 

MPI was designed in the 1990s to be a standardized library among heterogeneous parallel hardware computers. Open MPI is one version.

This Quick Start takes material from Chapter 1, Introduction to MPI by William Gropp in Parallel Programming Models, MIT Press. 2015. 

First, we will start with some MPI programming model concepts. Second, we will introduce some of the MPI functions.
